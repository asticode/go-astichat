# About

**Astichat** is an encrypted chat system written in GO. It's open-source and built the simplest way possible. Its main features are:

1) all messages are encrypted from start to finish through a public/private key encryption system
2) the private key is embedded in the binary therefore your binary **IS** your private key
3) if set up correctly, 2 clients can interact with each other directly without any messages going through any server
4) anyone can [set up an **Astichat** server](https://github.com/asticode/go-astichat/wiki/Set-up-the-server) and run its own encrypted chat server
